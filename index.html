He left Nueva Esparta state of Venezuela for the United States on September 11, 2023, traveling through the Darien jungle in Panama. He eventually arrived in Mexico, where he remained for a month awaiting his immigration appointment, which would grant him legal approval to enter the United States. This appointment was scheduled for December 9, 2023.Once he entered the U.S., Mikael settled in New York City with his partner, Glorybet Acosta.  Mikael worked as a barber in the US. The couple was doing well, but in February of 2023, Mikael was arrested by ICE. Glorybet posted a video that describes how Mikael was arrested: 'On February 13, 2025, when I was leaving work at 8 a.m., officers from ICE, the police, and the DEA arrived. They were asking about a person who supposedly lived here where we live. They showed me a photo and said he was Dominican. I told them I didn’t know who he was, and they asked the other person who was with me, and he didn’t know him either. They then asked if they could come into the house to check if it was the person they were looking for. I said it was fine, so I went in and woke up my partner [Mikael] because he was sleeping. When I woke him up and told him to get dressed, they immediately entered the house, handcuffed him, handcuffed me, and didn’t explain why they were doing this. They didn’t say anything, they just said they were investigating because they were looking for someone involved with mafia activities and crimes. They kept him under ICE custody. After that, they transferred him to Pennsylvania, to a correctional facility. Three days later, I didn’t hear from him until I found out through a video on Sunday, March 16, that he was in El Salvador. When he was transferred to El Salvador, the lawyer sent me some papers saying they were implicating him with the Tren de Aragua. Thank God Mikael has never committed any crime, he has never been incarcerated.'" </small

                    >"Rodmel José Angulo Orta, 32, is from the La Guaira state of Venezuela, according to his wife, Romeyvi Ortiz. Romeyvi met Rodmel in met in 2008…They have two boys, ages 12 and 10.The family lived for six years in Ecuador because of the economic situation in Venezuela but returned when Ecuador became dangerous. But when they returned to Venezuela, they faced the same economy that had driven them to migrate to Ecuador, “we had plates, but there was no food,” Romeyvi said. Rodmel has relatives who were in the United States, and they told him about the opportunity to enter legally using CPB-1. So, Rodmel, his brother and a cousin left Venezuela on the 25th of November 2023. The journey to the US was indeed difficult. Rodmel developed kidney stones from dehydration. His brother panicked in the Darien where they saw dead bodies and Romeyvi said they gave their food to a woman with six kids traveling alone. Then, Rodmel had to spend nearly a year waiting for his CPB-one appointment in Mexico. While he was waiting, he found work in a market. Rodmel was finally able to enter the US legally on a CPB-1 appointment on October 4, 2024. From the border, he traveled to Washington DC where he had relatives. He applied for a work permit and had a pending immigration court appointment. At first, he worked Uber, and later, on a military base. After Donald Trump won the Whitehouse, Rodmel became concerned about mass deportations and worried about his safety in the US. He has some cousins living in Canada who encouraged him to come there and claim asylum, which he did on February 5, 2025. “He thought it would be quicker to get all the papers he needed to bring me and the kids there,” Romeyvi said. Instead of allowing Rodmel to enter, Canadian officials arrested him and handed him over to US Immigration. The days went by, with no contact from Rodmel. His family became more and desperate; they went to the capital of Venezuela to file a missing person’s report. Finally, there was a news report listing the names of the seven Venezuelans believed to be on the April 13 flight. Rodmel’s name was on the list."</small

At the age of 17, Jose voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army, ready to defend the nation he nation he loved under a "Soldier to Citizen" contract. Upon his return from Iraq, SGT Barco grappled with the devastating, often unseen, consequences of his traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  In 2008, while battling severe and untreated combat trauma, SGT Barco was involved in an incident at a house party. During the event, he was reportedly pushed multiple times by other partygoers. His actions in response to this altercation led to a 2009 conviction for two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of felony menacing. In a powerful acknowledgment of the root causes of his past actions, the Colorado Board of Parole granted SGT Barco a full board unanimous parole on his very first attempt. Despite earning his freedom through the Colorado parole system SGT Jose Barco's long-awaited reunion with his family was tragically cut short. Instead of walking free, he was immediately detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Since then, SGT Barco has been trapped in indefinite ICE detention. He has been transferred between at least six different detention facilities in Colorado and Texas. He is currently at the ICE facility in Aurora, Colorado."</small

Daoud's wife, Jennifer Metz, told CBS News New York he was arrested during a regular meeting about his immigration status in March. He came to the U.S. over 20 years ago on a visa from Egypt and has been trying to become a permanent U.S. resident since, she said. An ICE spokesperson previously told CBS News New York that Daoud was arrested 'for violating U.S. immigration laws,' and that he is 'pending removal from the United States.' They did not specify what crimes he is accused of."</small

The police officer asked for all his documentation, license, work permit. Everything was in order and valid, but they still called ICE. Right there, they handcuffed him and took him into immigration custody. He has been detained since then. They transferred him to Alligator Alcatraz, where he is currently located. We have done everything possible with his lawyer to get him released on bail, but we have not yet had any luck so far. He is a family man, a good friend, and a hard worker.

He’s spent over two decades here, working, building a life, paying taxes, contributing to his community, and showing up—every single time—for his scheduled immigration check-ins. And yet, during his most recent routine check-in with ICE, Eric was suddenly taken into custody. Now, he faces deportation to a country that doesn’t even recognize him as a citizen. Eric and his family fled Venezuela when he was a child, escaping a brutal and dangerous regime. They came to the U.S. legally as Asylum Seekers looking for safety and a future. But because Eric was only 11 years old, he did not have citizenship documents —leaving him without recognized citizenship anywhere in the world. This lack of documentation has been the main reason he’s been denied U.S. citizenship again and again, despite doing everything he could to earn it."</small

I met my husband, Miguel Vaalmondes Barrios, in an Apple store in New York City in 2022, about a year after he came to the United States from Venezuela. I had two young children and that didn’t bother him. He wanted to be a family. He wanted to help me with my daughters. He has this innate fatherly spirit; he took on that role so effortlessly. We were together for two years and then we got married in 2024. He had TPS, and ongoing Asylum case and I had filed an I-130 petition for alien relative spouse, for him to get his green card. I gave birth to our daughter while he was in jail. We wanted to be together when she was born, to have that experience. Just not having him there was really difficult, really sad. Our baby is one year old now and he has never even held her. By the grace of God, last week, Miguel was released, along with 251 other unjustly imprisoned Venezuelans, put on a plane and sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap between the US and Venezuela."</small
